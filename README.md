# Web3

Hello! My name is **Pedro Henrique**, and I'm **20 years old**. I'm currently studying **Computer Science** and working as a **Full Stack Analyst Intern**.

While I enjoy my current focus, I'm really keen on **exploring new areas of development** beyond just web technologies. Specifically, I'm interested in **getting involved with the web3 community** to connect with others and discover **new horizons** and opportunities in the field.
